# Drop all forward packet

SERVER SIDE - CREATING AND SETTING UP A MANUAL SSH TUNNEL

SERVER SIDE 1:

# Manually start the SSH server
   /etc/init.d/ssh start
# Verify that port 22 is listening
   netstat -tpln
# Ensure that the root password is set
   passwd
# To check what happens with incoming connections you can monitor /var/log/auth.log
   tail -f /var/log/auth.log
#  Enable SSH tunneling in the configuration file (add the line 'PermitTunnel yes' or modify it, if any)
   pico /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# Restart the SSH server
   /etc/init.d/ssh restart

------ GO TO CLIENT SIDE.

SERVER SIDE 2:

#Check the presence the corresponding tun device.
   ifconfig -a

#Setting up a manual ifconfig tun0 10.0.0.132 pointopoint
	ifconfig tun0 10.1.0.132 pointopoint 10.1.0.131 up

#Verify that the other end of the tunnel is reachable
   ping 10.1.0.131

#Adding ARP public entry on eth1
   arp -sD 10.1.0.131 eth1 pub

#Check the ARP table
   arp -a


SERVER SIDE - SETTING UP A PERMANENT SSH TUNNEL

SERVER SIDE 1:

# Making permanent the start of the SSH server
   ln -s /etc/init.d/ssh /etc/rcS.d/S42ssh

# Verify that SSH appears in startup services
   ls -l /etc/rcS.d/ | less

------ Go to  CLIENT SIDE 1.

SERVER SIDE 2:

# List the public keys corresponding to users who are authorized to sign
   cat /root/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Add on top of the line corresponding to the client key just added
this line:
   command="ifdown tun0; ifup tun0",no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding

# Ensure that the directory /root and /root/.ssh have correct permissions
   chown -R root /root
   chmod go-r /root/.ssh

# Setting up tun0
   pico /etc/network/interfaces

# Add to the 'interfaces' file the above lines:

   iface tun0 inet static
        pre-up sleep 5
        address 10.1.0.132
        pointopoint 10.1.0.131
        netmask 255.255.255.255
        up arp -sD 10.1.0.131 eth1 pub

#If any, change the file permissions specified below (bind9 is a service
#which does not respond when an interface goes down, preventing the
#termination of the 'ifdown tun0' command)
   chmod -x /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/bind9

#Update the directive PermitRootLogin in /etc/ssh/sshd_config to the value 'without-password'.
#Restart the SSH server.
