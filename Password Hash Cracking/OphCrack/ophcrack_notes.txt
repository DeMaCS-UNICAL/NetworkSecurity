In order to retrieve hashes for password files we need to run in Ophcrack:

 Local SAM with samdump2

If using windows 10 anniversary samdump2 will not work or will provide hashes with empty passsword.

In order to dump hashes in windows 10 Anniversary SAM, we need to rely on Mimikatz: https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz

run as Administrator the following command:

./mimikatz.exe privilege::debug token::elevate lsadump::sam

this will show a message according to the one below.

User : developer
  Hash NTLM: 1937606ff74fb0e90c20ef11dc1c93bf
  
  
let's load in ophcrack the hash we just found using the previous command.

Install the vista_free rainbow table available here: http://ophcrack.sourceforge.net/tables.php
  
Proceed to crack the hash
