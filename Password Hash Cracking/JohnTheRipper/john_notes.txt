Let's start with installing John The Ripper:

apt-get install john

After installing we may proceed to test and benchmark the tool:

john --test

let's take a look on what are the "passwd" and "shadow" files in linux...

https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_(Unix)
https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passwd

let's create a password file starting from the passwd and shadow file

unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow > mypasswd.txt 

Now we may try to attack mypasswd.txt

john mypasswd.txt

John uses several attack modes, starting with single mode, then trying with wordlist mode Enumeration and finally with incremental modes. notes on modes usage are available at:
https://www.openwall.com/john/doc/MODES.shtml

we may build a dictionary in order to try thew wordlist mode.

crunch 4 4 > list.txt

now let's try the wordlist mode

john --wordlist=list.txt mypasswd.txt

to check the result of the command let's issue:

john --show mypassword.txt
