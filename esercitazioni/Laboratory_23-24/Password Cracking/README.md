# Crack Shadow Hashes on a Linux System

A couple files of particular interest on Linux systems are the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files. 

## `/etc/passwd` File
The `/etc/passwd` file contains basic information about each user account on the system, including the root user which has full administrative rights, system service accounts, and actual users. 
A typical line is composed by 7 different fields and it looks something like this:

`msfadmin:x:1000:1000:msfadmin,,,:/home/msfadmin:/bin/bash`

 1. The first field is the user's login name;
 2. The second field traditionally contained an encrypted password, but nowadays (unless you get extremely lucky) it merely contains the letter "x," to denote that a password has been assigned. If this field is blank, the user does not need to supply a password to log in;
 3. The third field is the user ID, a unique number assigned to the user;
 4. The fourth field is the group ID;
 5. The fifth field is typically the full name of the user, although this can also be left blank;
 6. The sixth field is the user's home directory;
 7. Finally, the seventh field is the default shell, usually set to `/bin/bash`

## `/etc/shadow` File

The `/etc/shadow` file contains the encrypted passwords of users on the system. While the `/etc/passwd` file is typically world-readable, the `/etc/shadow` is only readable by the root account. The shadow file also contains other information such as password expiration dates. A typical line in `/etc/shadow` will look like this:

`msfadmin:$1$XN10Zj2c$Rt/zzCW3mLtUWA.ihZjA5/:14684:0:99999:7:::`


## Cracking the Hashed Password using John the Ripper
### **Prerequisites**
 * The user must obtain a superuser privileges (see `privilege escalation attacks`)
 * Install `John the Ripper`
 
        sudo apt install john
 * Download a good dictionary (e.g., `rockyou`)

        mkdir /usr/share/rockyou
        cd /usr/share/rockyou
        wget https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt


### **Steps**
 1. First of all we need to make a copy of the `passwd` file and of the `shadow` file. As previosly said, the `shadow` file **\*cannot\*** be *read* by non-superuser thus, the following command must be executed as **root**
 
**BE CAREFUL: THERE IS A DOT (.) AT THE END OF THE 2 COMMANDS** 
        
        sudo cp /etc/passwd .
        sudo cp /etc/shadow .
        
 2. To turn an `/etc/shadow` file into a normal unix password file, we must use the `unshadow` utility. Then we can run `John the Ripper` in order to crack user passwords

        sudo unshadow passwd shadow > password.txt

 3. Now you can start cracking **your** password in order to evaluate its security

        john --format=crypt --wordlist=/usr/share/rockyou/rockyou.txt password.txt

 4. `Wait`
 5. Show the results

        sudo john --show password.txt


# Crack SAM Hashed Password on a Windows System
The **S**ecurity **A**ccounts **M**anager **(SAM)** is a database file in the Microsoft Windows operating system that contains usernames and passwords.

The primary purpose of the SAM is to make the system more secure and protect from a data breach in case the system is stolen. The SAM is available in different versions of Windows, starting from Windows XP to Windows 11.

Password and user list can be found in the following registry key
    
    HKLM\SAM
    HKLM\SYSTEM

## Cracking Windows Password
### **Prerequisites**
 * The user must obtain a superuser privileges (see `privilege escalation attacks`)
 * Disable Windows Defender
 * Download the following software
   * [`Mimikatz`](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/releases/download/2.2.0-20210810-2/mimikatz_trunk.zip)
   * [`OphCrack`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ophcrack/files/ophcrack/3.8.0/ophcrack-3.8.0-bin.zip/download)
   * [`OphCrack Tables`](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ophcrack/files/tables/Vista%20proba%20free/vista_proba_free.zip/download)


### **Steps**
 1. Dump the SAM files

     1.1. Open a `PowerShell` as admin and execute the following commands

        reg save HKLM\SAM sam.bkp
        reg save HKLM\SYSTEM sys.bkp
 2. Extract hashes

    2.1. From the `PowerShell` as admin execute the following commands

        mimikatz.exe
        privilege::debug
        token::elevate
        log hash.log
        lsadump::sam sys.bkp sam.bkp
    
    2.2. Open file `hash.txt` and look for users you want to test password security
    
    2.3. Extract the following user informatiion
              
        Username
        User ID (optional)
        Hash NTLM
    
    2.4. Go to the `ophcrack/x64` folder
    
    2.5. Create a file named `users.txt` and paste the following information

        Username:User_ID::Hash_NTLM:::
    2.6. `users.txt` file example in which the `User_ID` field is empty

        francesco:::57158936eqke28fho38fuw74y9fwnplas:::

 3. Crack the password
 
    3.1. Start `ophcrack.exe` as admin

    3.2. Click on `load --> PWDUMP` and select the `users.txt` file
